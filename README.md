# Code First Girls Big-Data-Challenge 2020-Team-A

**Description of Project**  
Our Juypter Notebook enables reading in, displaying and analysing data from our own Google Cloud hosted database. The data on the database is provided in CSV files, allowing straightforward access to the files. 

**Running the application:**  
We have produced a standalone Jupyter Notebook. When running this notebook, it accesses our own database hosted on Google Clouds.

**Features:**

1. **Electricity Modelling with Facebook Prophet**: 


2. **Whatever Suzi and Anto have analysed **



3. **Analysis of UK population mobility**:
Using data on petrol and diesel sales for 2020 so far as well as the Oxford Stringency Index, we analysed the effects of government policies and rules on mobility. Further, we looked at both Apple’s and Google’s mobility data to analyse potential results from the lockdown rules.
Our overall finding is that the government's measures decreased mobility, reflected in changes in habits and means of transports.
